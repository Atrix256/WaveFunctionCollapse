===== NOW =====
* collect patterns
* rotate / reflect them, as parameters dictate
* support params: periodicInput, symmetry, N, ground
* do rest of constructor work

* do the rest of the stuff from the C# version! (overlapped version first)
* show timings
* make it command line based?
 * is there anything we can thread? even doing fork/join work to get tiles or anything?

===== LATER =====
* blog post about overlapped version
* do simple tiled model
* think about other ways to do things
 * maybe JFA and get it running on GPU?
 * try it with realistic images like you'd see in games?
 * for realistic images there are way more colors, and it isn't as hard a rule about which colors can go together. Can we use that as an advantage?







===== DONE =====
